# Product Brief — SIH Website (Digital Guidance Platform for Students)

## 1. Problem / Opportunity
The decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not primarily due to poor infrastructure or teaching quality, but due to a **critical lack of awareness**. Students and their parents often do not understand:
- The importance of graduation.
- Which subject streams (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational) to pursue after Class 10 or 12.
- The career opportunities each degree course unlocks.
- Which nearby government colleges offer relevant programs.
- Why long-term graduation may be a better path compared to short-term courses.

This knowledge gap leads to poor decisions, dropouts, or unnecessary migration to private institutions with questionable outcomes.

## 2. Goals (SMART)
- **Primary Goal:** Help at least 80% of pilot users make informed subject/course decisions within 2 weeks of onboarding.  
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Increase enrollment in nearby government colleges by ≥15% in pilot districts within 1 year.
  - Reduce Class 10 & 12 dropout rates by ≥10%.
  - Deliver personalized student guidance in ≤3 clicks.

## 3. Target Audience (Personas)

### A. School Students
- **Class 10 Students (CBSE, ICSE, State Boards)**  
  - Need clarity on choosing streams (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational).  
  - Confused about which stream matches their interests, strengths, and future career goals.  
  - Example: A Class 10 student unsure whether to pursue PCM (Science with Maths), PCB (Science with Biology), Commerce with Maths, or Humanities.  

- **Class 12 Students (Across Boards)**  
  - Want to know what degrees they can pursue based on their chosen stream.  
  - Example pathways:  
    - **Science (PCM):** B.Tech, B.Sc., NDA, Merchant Navy.  
    - **Science (PCB):** MBBS, BDS, B.Pharm, B.Sc. Nursing, B.Sc. Life Sciences.  
    - **Commerce:** B.Com, BBA, CA Foundation, CS, CMA.  
    - **Arts/Humanities:** B.A., BSW, BFA, Journalism, LLB (5-year).  
  - Often confused between professional degrees (e.g., B.Tech, MBBS, Law) vs. general degrees (e.g., B.Sc., B.A.).

### B. Undergraduate Students
- Students already pursuing graduation but unclear about next steps.  
- Example degree programs in India:  
  - **Professional Degrees:** B.Tech, MBBS, BDS, B.Pharm, B.Arch, LLB, BBA.  
  - **General Degrees:** B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., BSW.  
- Need career mapping for:  
  - Higher studies (M.Tech, MBA, M.Sc., M.A., LLM).  
  - Govt exams (UPSC, SSC, Banking, State PSC).  
  - Private sector jobs.  
  - Entrepreneurship opportunities.

### C. Postgraduate Aspirants
- Graduates planning advanced studies but lacking clarity on options.  
- Example postgraduate degrees: MBA, MCA, M.Tech, M.Sc., M.A., LLM, MD/MS, MDS, M.Pharm.  
- Need guidance on:  
  - Entrance exams (CAT, GATE, NEET-PG, CLAT-PG, CSIR-NET).  
  - Job-oriented vs. research-oriented paths.  
  - Overseas study opportunities (GRE, GMAT, IELTS prep).  

### D. Parents & Guardians
- Primary decision influencers, especially in rural/semi-urban areas.  
- Want reliable, simplified information about streams, colleges, costs, and long-term career value.  
- Need confidence that **government colleges are a strong, affordable option**.

### E. Education Stakeholders
- **Teachers, Counselors, NGOs:** Help guide students but lack structured tools.  
- **Government Departments:** Need data-driven dashboards to monitor enrollment, dropouts, and outcomes.

## 4. Value Proposition & USP
- **USP 1: Personalized Roadmap** — Every student gets a **visual roadmap** showing:
  - Current academic stage.
  - Recommended streams & degrees.
  - Possible career options.
  - Next steps (admissions, scholarships, exams).  
- **USP 2: Localized College Guidance** — Location-based government college directory with real-time cut-offs, eligibility, facilities, and admission notifications.  
- **USP 3: AI-driven Suggestions** — Based on aptitude quiz + interests, the platform generates **tailored course/college/career recommendations**.  
- **USP 4: Awareness + Accessibility** — Multilingual support + offline features ensure inclusivity for rural areas.  

## 5. Scope & Constraints
- **In-Scope (MVP):**
  - Aptitude quiz → course stream suggestions.
  - Visual course-to-career mapping.
  - Government college directory (location-based).
  - Profile-based roadmap & reminders (admission/scholarship timelines).
- **Out-of-Scope (Hackathon MVP):**
  - Advanced AI engine (use basic rules/logic at first).
  - Nationwide rollout (focus on a few districts).
  - Integration with 3rd-party exams/job portals.
- **Constraints:**
  - Limited time (hackathon schedule).
  - Small dev team.
  - Reliance on government data availability.

## 6. Success Metrics
- % of students completing aptitude quiz.
- % of students who explore ≥2 career roadmaps.
- Increase in awareness measured via in-app surveys.
- Engagement: Daily Active Users (DAU), retention after 7 days.
- Impact: % rise in applications to government colleges.

## 7. Timeline
- **Hackathon Phase:** Prototype with working frontend + basic recommendation engine.  
- **Pilot Launch (District level):** Next 3–6 months.  
- **Scale-up (State/National):** After 1 year, depending on adoption.  

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
- **Data Accuracy Risk:** Outdated college/course info → Mitigate via direct govt partnerships.  
- **Low Adoption Risk:** Students may ignore → Gamify quizzes & provide scholarships/resources.  
- **Tech Risk:** Poor internet in rural areas → Offline mode + SMS alerts.
